\title{Drop All Possible Single Terms to a GWRM Model}
\usage{
\method{drop1}{gw}(object, scope, test = c("none", "Chisq"), k = 2,
  trace = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted object of class inheriting from "gw".}

\item{scope}{a formula giving the terms to be considered for dropping.}

\item{test}{"none", which considers the AIC criterion, or Chisq, which is the likelihood-ratio test.}

\item{k}{the penalty constant in AIC / Cp.}

\item{trace}{if TRUE, print out progress reports.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
An object of class "anova" summarizing the differences in fit between the models.
}
\description{
Compute all the single terms in the scope argument that can be dropped from the GWRM model, fit those models and compute a table of the changes in fit.
}
\examples{
data(goals)

fit0 <- gw(goals ~ offset(log(played)), data = goals)
summary(fit0)

fit1 <- step(fit0, ~ position)
summary(fit1)
}
